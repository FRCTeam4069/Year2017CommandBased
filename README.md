## Contributing
* All team members wishing to contribute should commit directly to the `develop` branch, where code will be tested.
* Code from `develop` that has been tested and guaranteed to be stable and as bug-free as possible is merged into `master`.
* At competitions, we should use the `develop` branch for quick changes so that we have the stable `master` to fall back on in case of serious problems.

## Style Guide
Team members are asked to import `FRC4069-Style-Guide-Eclipse.xml` or `FRC4069-Style-Guide-IntelliJ.xml` (depending on whether they are using Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA) into their IDEs and format code files appropriately.
